    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nYour task is to write an Opinion-Editorial (Op-ed) piece that applies the economic way of thinking to some public policy-relevant issue. An op-ed is a newspaper article that expresses the opinions of a writer who is unaffiliated with the newspaper or its editorial board. Often, the writer of an op-ed has no journalism experience, or (as you will soon discover), little understanding of economics. Thus, you are at no disadvantage as a student just beginning your experience with economics and writing! To get an idea, look at any newspaper’s “Opinion” section on their website or in print.\nThe purpose of this assignment is fourfold: (1) to demonstrate to you that economics is a wonderful way of thinking about any social issue, (2) for you to demonstrate to me that you have mastered the material of this course, (3) to develop your writing and argumentative skills, and (4) to help you develop, change, and/or strengthen your own views by grappling with them in writing.\nIn general, am looking for a short paper that puts forth an argument and defends it. You should be able to summarize your position in one sentence – the thesis of your paper that you will argue for. It should be a reasonably original argument (it is difficult with limited knowledge to offer something truly original), and it should be your own take on the topic. It should use some principle(s) or insight(s) from (micro) economics to bolster your conclusions.\nPlease note that, while you are not required to, I highly recommend discussing your ideas with me over email or in person. I will also read any drafts you would like to submit to me early, and provide you with helpful comments, subject to my own availability. Both to disincentivize procrastination, and because I have no time to read 100 papers right before the end of class, I will stop reading and commenting on drafts after November 31\nIf you publish your op-ed in any media outlet (newspapers, news websites, major blogs) by the end of the semester, you will earn extra credit according to the following scale:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication\nExamples\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nHood-affiliated outlet\nThe Blue and Grey, Professors’ blogs\n10\n\n\nLocal/regional Newspaper\nFrederick News-Post\n20\n\n\nNational Newspaper/blog\nNY Times, WaPo, WSJ, USA Today, HuffPo\n40\n\n\n\nMeeting the market test is what matters most!\nYour Op-Ed, with a word count, is due by 11:59 PM Monday December 6, via Chalk-and-Wire upload, and constitutes 20% of your final course grade."

    "section": "Length, References, & Mechanics",
    "text": "Length, References, & Mechanics\nThe goal of any op-ed is to convince reasonably-educated readers of some particular conclusion (also known as a thesis). This conclusion is of course, the opinion of the author, but this opinion must be backed by theory and evidence that leads reasonable people to agree with that conclusion. The claim you make as your conclusion should be relevant, debatable, testable, and provide new insight on a topic. Telling the reader “people who do not recycle are selfish” is neither informative nor persuasive, but telling the reader “recycling reduces the amount of trash going into local landfills by X tons a year” is at least informative, if not also persuasive. You are free to take any position on any issue that you choose, so long as it is backed by evidence and sound use of the economic way of thinking. For more details, see my presentation slides linked above.\nI always hesitate to give formal length requirements, because most students will write the bare minimum, and also because different papers have different optimal lengths. What truly matters is that your paper is long enough to say what you need to say, to say it well, and to say it briefly. Ceterus paribus, if papers A and B say the same thing, but paper B says it in half the length (without sacrificing key arguments), paper B is a better paper. In any event, this assignment will largely follow the style of most major newspapers. Your op-ed must be between 500 and 1000 words. You must include a word count with your final copy. There are no other formal requirements but, I recommend formatting it in 12 point Times New Roman or Arial font, double spaced, just to make it easier for me to read (and nearly every other paper you write will ask for this).\nWhile this is not a research paper, I do want you to include some scholarly sources – for example, if you cite the work of an economist on the issue, or if you use statistics, data, or facts (which you should!). While newspapers do not publish a bibliography for each op-ed, they will scrutinize every empirical claim and ask the author for sources to back it up. Thus, I would like a list of sources you used for your article, and expect you to have at least 1-3, depending on your topic and argument. I am not particularly picky about exactly how you format this list, just please be consistent. Look at my slides or my handouts for a suggested style."

    "text": "Suggested Topics\nRemember that economics is a way of analyzing the world, rather than a narrow domain of topics for studying. Thus, while you may certainly write about the typical “mundane” topics of economics we often think about (money, monopoly, inflation, etc), I strongly encourage you to apply economics to something you find much more interesting about the world - from corruption in FIFA, to the constitutional political economy of pirates, to bitcoin displacing currencies, to the illegal downloading of Game of Thrones, to the cultural institutions of the Jersey Shore, to the monopoly power of the WWE in wrestling, to the relationship of Uber & Airbnb to taxis and hotels, to the privatization of asteroids, to the economics of crowdfunding, to drugs, sex, and rock n roll. In fact, it is often those topics that are most eccentric and “out in left field” that make the best op-eds!\nThere are plenty of issues around us, both immediate and visible (racism and policing, college costs, ISIS, planned parenthood, gun control, etc) and latent long term issues (monetary policy and interest rates, the drug war, government spending and debt, science funding, etc).\nThe scope of topics allowed for your paper is anything that uses the economic way of thinking to make some sort of conclusion. This is an extremely wide scope, but here are a few main types of op-eds that will tend to result from this, along with some great examples of op-eds that use economics to reach an interesting or provocative conclusion.\n\nTaking a stand on a position, either actively being discussed in the news, or a long-standing underlying issue\n\n\nThe Case for Getting Rid of Borders - Completely (The Atlantic)\nThe Racial Reality of Policing (Wall Street Journal)\nZoning Out the Poor (Washington Post)\nThis Child Doesn’t Need a Solar Panel (Wall Street Journal)\nHow to Save Detroit (Wall Street Journal)\nIn an Uber World, Fortune Favors the Freelancer (New York Times)\nWhat the West Gets Wrong About Russia (New York Times)\n\n\nCriticizing recent statements, current popular fallacies, or policy proposals of others in the news\n\n\nShut Up Royal Baby Haters, Monarchy is Awesome (Washington Post)\nTrump’s Protectionist Fallacies Have Been Refuted By Free Market Economists for Hundreds of Years (Huffington Post)\nTrump’s Exploits Rational Ignorance (USA Today)\nBernie Sanders on Immigrants: Silly, Tribal and Economically Illiterate (Newsweek)\nThe Myth of a Stagnant Middle Class (Wall Street Journal)\nThe ‘77 cents on the Dollar’ Myth About Women’s Pay (Wall Street Journal)\nHow Everyone Gets the Sharing Economy Wrong (Wall Street Journal)\nWhy Bill Gates Hates my Book (Wall Street Journal)\nIn Zimbabwe, We Don’t Cry for Lions (New York Times)\n\n\nProviding new insight into a social phenomenon that is interesting or novel, designed to get people talking\n\n\nDriven to Kill: Why Drivers in China Intentionally Kill the Pedestrians they Hit (Slate)\nThe Case for the City-State (Wall Street Journal)\nWhat Hollywood Can Teach Us About the Future of Work (New York Times)\nLosing is Good for You (New York Times)\nThe $250 Econ 101 Textbook (Wall Street Journal)\nCash for Kidneys: The Case for a Market for Organs (Wall Street Journal)\nThe Bitcoin Schism Shows the Genius of Open Source (Wired)\nShould Physician Pay Be Tied to Performance?

Therefore, don’t use terms, sources, or “inside jokes” that only other students in this class (and no one else) would understand.] Remember, your goal is not to convince me (though you may), your goal is to convince any educated reader, and I grade you the probability that this is likely. You are the lawyer, I am the judge, and your audience is the jury.\nSoundness: Are your theories consistent and logical, and did you apply them correctly? Did you choose relevant (and non-cherry picked) evidence to back it up? Are your facts, data, or case studies accurate?\nClarity How clear is your paper? Is it clear what your research question is, how you answer it, and what your results are? Can you summarize these in a sentence or two? Are there confusing passages, excessive jargon or passive voice, or irrelevant arguments and examples?\nOrganization: Is your paper organized? Have you presented your separate arguments/examples in a logical order? Is it clear when you are moving on from one section to another? Is it clear when and where you are summarizing and concluding?\nReferences: Does your paper use multiple reputable references? Does it properly cite them in the text for main ideas borrowed and for direct quotations? Are they consistently listed at the end in a references section?\nStyle: Is your paper interesting and easy to read? Does it engage the reader? Is it written in active voice? This is somewhat subjective, and hence, the smallest portion of your grade."

    "section": " Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nWe are diving right into what is commonly called “Consumer Theory” in textbooks. While our paradigmatic example will indeed be a consumer deciding what goods and services to purchase, please recognize that this model can be applied to just about any decision made by an individual. We should more appropriately describe it as “Rational Choice Theory”. This will take several classes to fully unpack as our formal model of constrained optimization, so today we are only focusing on the constraints using the tool known as the “budget constraint.”\nWhile budget constraints are fairly straightforward, consumer theory often the most “alien” material to students of economics: preferences, indifference curves, and utility functions derived from behavioral axioms. The model we put together—constrained optimization—is borrowed from calculus and engineering. In my opinion, a good chunk of consumer theory, particularly about preferences (next class), is a waste of your time and will give you unnecessary anxiety. It’s perhaps neat for you to see how economists ground all of their models in utility-maximization, but our time is better spent on more productive things. If, however, you plan on going to graduate school for economics or social science, read this chapter, and my online appendices, in great detail.1"

It also stars with the “newer” and “weirder” stuff first — indifference curves and utility functions, and then teaches budget constraints second.

If you look at the textbook chapter, I am skipping a lot of “the fat,” and relegating it to an appendix at the bottom of this page. I used to spend an entire week just teaching about preferences. Again, I reiterate that if you are interested in more advanced economics training, it is essential that you master all of these details. But not for this course.\nToday we focus on the essential tools for fitting preferences into our optimization model:\n\nindifference curves: each of which is the set of all bundles that one is indifferent between (and that give the same amount utility)\nutility functions: which measure the ordinal (but not cardinal!) utility level of any given bundle; for comparisons only!\nmarginal rate of substitution: the slope of the indifference curve, representing an individual’s subjective tradeoff between goods; measured by the ratio of marginal utilities: \\(MRS_{x,y}=-\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}\\)"

Economics at the graduate and professional level begins with abstract models of \\(n\\) number of goods in an economy. Naturally, we cannot graph this, so we must deal in abstract equations and set theory:\nLet \\(\\{x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n\\}\\) denote the set of \\(n\\) goods in an economy. Let \\(\\{p_1,p_2, \\cdots, p_n\\}\\) denote the set of market prices affiliated with each good. Let \\(m\\) again denote an individual’s income.\nFor \\(n\\) goods, the budget set is defined as:\n\\[p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 + \\cdots + p_n x_n \\leq m\\]\nWhich we can simplify, using summation notation, as:\n\\[\\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i \\leq m\\]\nTo get the limit of this set, the budget constraint, make it an equality:\n\\[\\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i = m\\]\nAs usual, this simply says that one’s total expenditures (on all goods) on the left-hand side, must be equal to one’s income on the right-hand side."

But the general idea comes from assumption 2 of preferences: any two bundles can be compared, as we can compare two points on this graph and make a judgment.\n\nIndifference curves are monotonic, which means practically that “more is preferred to less”\n\nFor any bundle \\(b\\) with more of at least one good than bundle \\(a \\implies a \\prec b\\).

In this case, we would violate the assumption of monotonicity!\n\nIndifference curves are convex, which means in practice that “averages are preferred to extremes”\n\nFrom experience, people generally prefer variety in their consumption. Rather than having one bundle that is “extreme” (a lot of one good and little or none of another), they tend to prefer a bundle with a better “mix” or “balance” of some of both goods.\nTake our example from class, hunting for apartments. Apartment \\(A\\) is very large but near very few friends, whereas apartment \\(B\\) is very small but near many friends. If we could find some apartment, \\(C\\), that is a weighted average of the two, with a better mix of size and friends, it would be preferred, and thus, on a higher indifference curve than \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)!\nMathematically, this feature is because indifference curves are normally convex. A function is convex when a line connecting any two points on the function lies above the function itself.

    "text": "Utility Functions for Perfect Substitutes\nPerfect substitutes produce straight lines for indifference curves. A straight line has a constant slope, which is interpretted as the MRS being constant - you should always be willing to substitute between the two goods at the same rate. The utility function looks like:\n\\[u(x,y)=w_xx+w_yy\\]\nWhere each \\(w_i\\) is a relative weight (intensity of relative preference). These are often known as linear preferences because the utility of the two goods are related by addition.\nNotice, having some of one good and none of the other still provides positive utility (unlike utility functions where the quantities of goods are multiplied!). This is precisely because of the substitutability between the goods!\n\nExample\nConsider 1-Liter bottles of Coke \\(L_{1}\\) and 2-Liter bottles of Coke \\(L_{2}\\). You should always be willing to substitute between one 2-Liter bottle and two 1-Liter bottles.\n\\[u_{L_{1},L_{2}}=1L_{1}+2L_{2}\\]\nThe relative weights here are 1 for 1-Liter bottles and 2 for 2-Liter bottles, because 2-Liter bottles are “worth” twice as much for you (it takes two 1-Liter bottles to match a 2-Liter bottle!).\n\\(MRS_{L_{1},L_{2}}=-\\frac{w_x}{w_y} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\n\nWarning: `expand_scale()` is deprecated; use `expansion()` instead.\n\nWarning: `expand_scale()` is deprecated; use `expansion()` instead."

This is technically not a mathematical function, since each \\(X\\) value must be mapped to a single \\(Y\\) value (i.e. no vertical lines). Thus, the utility function for perfect complements \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is quite unique:\n\\[u(x,y)=min\\{w_xx,w_yy\\}\\]\nWhere each \\(w_i\\) is a relative weight (intensity of relative preference). Utility is determined by the lesser value of what you have, \\(x\\) (weighted by \\(w_x\\)) or \\(y\\) (weighted by \\(w_y\\)). These are sometimes called “Leontief preferences”.\nThe marginal rate of substitution alternates between \\(0\\) (horizontal line) and \\(\\infty\\) (vertical line).\n\nExample\nConsider consuming hot dogs \\((H)\\) and buns \\((B)\\), that must be consumed together as a package 1:1. The utility function would be:\n\\[u(H,B)=min\\{H,B\\}\\]\nHaving 2 hot dogs and 3 buns only yields a utility of 2. Having 3 hot dogs and 2 buns also only yields a utility of 2.\n\n\nWarning: `expand_scale()` is deprecated; use `expansion()` instead.\n\nWarning: `expand_scale()` is deprecated; use `expansion()` instead."

As such, this class assumes you have met the required prerequisite courses by taking principles of microeconomics (ECON 206).\nI reserve the right to change any part of this syllabus and course, at my discretion, with proper advance warning."

    "text": "Attendence\nYour day-to-day classroom attendance is not graded. My philosophy is that you are all adults and must take ownership of your own learning or else you will not succeed. Some assignments may require in-class participation for credit, and an (unexcused) absence may be detrimental to your grade. Attending class is one of the strongest predictors of success.\nHowever, as required under Hood College’s “Promise of Fall Plan,” (Ch. 2-C) your classroom attendance will be recorded at every class meeting. This is primarily to facilitate contact tracing.\nIf you know you will be absent, you are not required to let me know, but it is polite to give notice (Note if I do not reply to an email of yours letting me know, I am probably busy but will still see it and appreciate your email). Your absence will be noted and recorded for the purposes stated above. If, however, we have an assignment due in class, you must notify me ahead of time in order to make alternate arrangements to still receive credit. Hasty ex-post attempts to notify me will generate little sympathy."

Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\nHomeworks: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 20 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 80).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an in-class exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nOp-eds: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your Op-ed is late.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment."

Blackboard’s Grading Center is the place to look for your most up-to-date grades.

Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. Please do not reply to any automated Blackboard emails - I may not recieve it!. My Hood email (safner@hood.edu) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and feel free to send a follow up email in the very likely event that I genuinely did not see your original message.\nOur slack channel is available to all students and faculty in Economics and Business. I have invited all of my classes and advisees. It will not be extended to non-Business/Economics students or faculty. All users must use their hood emails and true first and last names. Each course has its own channel, exclusive for verified students in the course, and myself, by my invite only. As a third party platform, you agree to its Terms of Service. I have created this space as a way to stay connected, to help one another, and to foster community. Behaviors such as posting inappropriate content, harassing others, or engaging in academic dishonesty, to be determined solely at my discretion, will result in one warning, the content will be deleted, and subsequent behavior will result in a ban.\nIn addition to in-person office hours, you can also make an appointment for “office hours” on Zoom. You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack. If you want to go over material from class, please have specific questions you want help with. I am not in the business of giving private lectures (particularly if you missed class without a valid excuse).\nWatch this excellent and accurate video explaining office hours:"

Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X’?” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”)."

If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your specific needs.
